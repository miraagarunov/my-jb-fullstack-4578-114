        <h3>So What Is Cascading Style Sheet</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming design language that includes all relevant information relating to the display of a webpage. CSS defines the style and formatting of a website or page, including the layout, colors, fonts, padding (the space around each element) and more. 

            Together with HTML and Javascript, CSS makes up the foundation of how the internet works and play a signficant role within the world of website development. The standards and specifications for all three are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  </p>

            <p>CSS pertains only to the design of the webpage, while the content of the page is defined using a markup language such as HTML. This separation of style and content has many advantages, among them are improved accessibility, and more control over web design.
 
                CSS documents are used to define the style of a webpage, and are then linked to the HTML document (or a document in different markup language) which contains the content and structure of the page. Setting the style directly in the HTML document is possible, but not recommended. 
                
                CSS documents can be created in any text editor, like Text Editor in Mac or Notepad in Windows, as well as many other free or paid options that you can download</p>
