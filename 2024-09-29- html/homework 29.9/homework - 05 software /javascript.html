        <h3>So what is JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a client-side programming language used to create dynamic interactions in app, game and web development. Commonly represented as JS, this language is considered one of the core technologies of the web in conjunction with HTML and CSS. 

        Developers use JavaScript to bring a webpage to life, as it transforms an otherwise static page into one that responds to user engagement, livens up the page with motion, and displays real-time, variable, and personalized content</p>

       <h3>What JavaScript used for</h3>
       <p>Website interactivity and engagement are important in this day and age. As users attention spans’ wane, a static website just won’t do. As such, JavaScript has a critical role to play in web development. There are a wide range of use cases for JavaScript, with the most common ones including:
       <li>Web apps</li> 
       <li>Mobile apps</li>
       <li>Servers</li> 
       <li>Server applications</li>
       <li>Games</li>
        
       <p>Furthermore, JS can also be useful for web developers or designers who want more control over the dynamic nature of their websites.</p>
